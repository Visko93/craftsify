# Craftisy:
The idea:  A website and mobile application to provide a learning structure for those who want or need to learn a new craft. This idea came after seeing the rise in unemployment genergated by the pandemic and many struggle to cope with the new realities of needing to learn a new trade.

# What it will do
We are not creating our own material, rather we hope that in the future we will be able to use datascience and machine learning algorithms to more effectiantly gather the hundreds of already existing youtube videos and other learning content to generate the content for different structured and directed programs of study for those looking to master different non-technical crafts and trades

# How it works
Sample Track: Learn to sew

Start with videos teaching you how to thread a needle
Review Images and diagrams of different types of thread, different size needles and items that require different stitching patterns
Begin with easier projects and work your way through more complicated ones
Learn different stitches, ways to finish off a stitch, how to use a sewing machine if you have one and more
